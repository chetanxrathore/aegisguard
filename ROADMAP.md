# AegisGuard Roadmap

## Near-term
- JSON export alongside HTML (for SIEM/SOAR ingestion)
- Modular “check plugins” architecture
- CIS Benchmark mapping for Windows 10/11 & Server
- Evidence capture for each finding (registry path, command output hashes)

## Mid-term
- Optional remediation mode (explicit opt-in) with rollback support
- Scheduled scan mode + diff reports (baseline comparisons)
- Central dashboard ingestion (GitHub Pages or lightweight web app)

## Next-gen
- Threat-informed scoring (MITRE ATT&CK mapping)
- Policy-as-code: organization profiles (YAML) for controls
- Local risk model tuned to org policy (weights + exceptions)
